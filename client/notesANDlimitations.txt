limitations:
---------------------
no limit in hotel rooms. would define a number in database per day and query downward. overly complicated
and backend heavy for this project

woudl liek to get rid of alert on selecting day before present

change googel maps api key to hotelnomasf@gmail.com

make weather grab work

room inventory management

should have used Saas. More organized CSS. still trying to get better at react

no login. wanted to make this simple. focus on core functions

aesthetics. styling. time limitation

limit stay to 30 days max

modify dates part of navigation. done immmediatley instead of linking

//future feature: dynamic pricing. Increase by a % factor if date lands on weekend
//future: can pay for someone, stay someone e.se

customizing room selections based on number of guests

customize number of breakfasts and shuttle rides

refund after cancelling. can be done manually on stripe dashboard thoguh

currently deletes reservation from db entirely. maybe better to set everything to null and deleted = yes

actually make use of cancel by date. Its one day before date of stay.

change grammar if 1 night vs 2
//to-do: functional modify search button

//to-do: define number of rooms available per day, see if available. If conditions not met, remove from results


highlights:
---------------------
easily modifiable prices. Change pricing reducer
confirmation number easy to follow for employees at quick glance
default same day stay, 1 adult.
everything rendered on client side (redux store) then sent to backend all at once after chekcout
all dates defined using momentJS. Everything is local to PST (location of fictitious hotel)
include stripe dashboard screenshot
include hotel noma storyboard scan

notes:
---------------------
in doucments show sample output from mongo
